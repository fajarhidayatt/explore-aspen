## Description

Explore Aspen is a lodging search application in the city of Aspen, USA. In this application there are search, recommendation and favorite features. This application can also display detailed information from each lodging such as image, name, rating, description and price.

This application is the first application that I made using Flutter and is the result of a project that I used as a submission in one of the online training classes.

## Design
